# 0x0A. Prime Game

Welcome to the `0x0A. Prime Game` repository! This project is designed to tackle an engaging coding challenge centered around prime numbers and game theory.

## Overview

The `Prime Game` involves a series of computational problems and tasks related to prime numbers. The main goal is to develop algorithms and strategies to solve these problems efficiently. This project is ideal for individuals looking to enhance their problem-solving skills in number theory and algorithm design.

## Directory Structure

- `README.md` - This file provides an overview of the project.
- `prime_game.py` - Contains the main implementation of the Prime Game logic.
- `test_prime_game.py` - Includes test cases to validate the functionality of the Prime Game implementation.
- `examples/` - Contains example inputs and outputs for the Prime Game.
- `docs/` - Documentation and additional resources related to the Prime Game.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Prime Game, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/0x0A-prime-game.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd 0x0A-prime-game
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   If there are any dependencies or specific versions required, they should be listed in a `requirements.txt` file or a similar document. Install them using:
