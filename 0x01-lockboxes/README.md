# 0x01. Lockboxes

This project is part of the Alx - SE curriculum of software engineering. The main objective is to understand and implement the concepts of Algorithms with Python.

## Overview

This project is focus on solving a specific problem: determining if all boxes can be opened. Each box may contain keys to the other boxes, and the goal is to find out if there is a way to open all boxes.

## Key Concepts

The solution to this problem involves several key concepts:

- **List Manipulation:** The boxes and their keys are represented as lists, so understanding how to work with lists is crucial.
- **Graph Theory:** The problem can be viewed as a graph traversal problem, where each box is a node and each key is an edge.
- **Algorithmic Complexity:** The efficiency of the solution is important, so understanding time and space complexity is key.
- **Recursion and Iteration:** The solution may involve traversing through the boxes and keys using recursion or iteration.
- **Data Structures:** Understanding how to use data structures like queues, stacks, and sets can be helpful.

## Requirements

- Python 3.4.3
- PEP 8 style

## Usage

Run the script with Python to see if all boxes can be opened:

```bash
$ ./main_0.py
```
