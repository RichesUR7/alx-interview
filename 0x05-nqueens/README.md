 # 0x05. N Queens


This directory contains solutions to the N Queens puzzle, a classic problem in computer science and combinatorial mathematics. The problem involves placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.


## Description

The N Queens problem is a fundamental example of backtracking algorithms. It is an excellent exercise for understanding recursive problem-solving and constraint satisfaction problems. In this project, you will implement algorithms to solve the N Queens puzzle and explore different techniques and optimizations.


## Files

- 0-nqueens.py: A script that solves the N Queens problem using a backtracking approach. It reads the value of N from the command line and prints all possible solutions.
- README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project and its components.


## Usage

To run the solution script, use the following command:

      python3 0-nqueens.py N

Replace N with the size of the chessboard and the number of queens.


## Example

      python3 0-nqueens.py 4

This command will output all valid solutions for placing 4 queens on a 4×4 chessboard.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x


## Project Structure

- 0-nqueens.py: The main solution file implementing the backtracking algorithm.
- tests/: Directory containing test cases to validate the solution (if applicable).


## Learning Objectives

- Understand the N Queens problem and its constraints.
- Implement a backtracking algorithm to solve the problem.
- Explore optimizations to improve the performance of the solution.
- Gain experience with recursive programming techniques.
