## Description

In this project, you will implement a function to determine the minimum number of operations required to reach a target number n starting from 1, using only two operations:

1. Copy All: Copy all characters from the current state.
2. Paste: Paste the copied characters.

You will write a Python function minOperations(n) that calculates this minimum number of operations.

## Requirements

- All your files should be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.
- All your files should end with a new line.
- The length of your files will be tested using wc.

## Usage

To use the minOperations function, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Create or open a Python file and import the minOperations function.
4. Call the function with a target number n and observe the result.


from min_operations import minOperations



n = 9

print(minOperations(n))  # Output: 6

## Example

For a given number n = 9, the minimum number of operations required is 6. The operations are as follows:

1. Copy All (1 operation)
2. Paste (2 operations)
3. Paste (3 operations)
4. Copy All (4 operations)
5. Paste (5 operations)
6. Paste (6 operations)
