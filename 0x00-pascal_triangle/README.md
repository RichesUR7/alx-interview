# Pascal's Triangle Generator

## Overview

- This directory contains Python scripts to generate Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows. Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical construct where each element is the sum of the two elements directly above it, forming a triangular array of binomial coefficients.

## Files

- **0-pascal_triangle.py**: Contains the implementation of a function to generate Pascal's Triangle as a list of lists of integers.
- **0-main.py**: A sample script demonstrating the usage of the `pascal_triangle` function and how to print the triangle.

## Usage

- To generate and print Pascal's Triangle for a specified number of rows:

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.

2. Run the `0-main.py` script with the desired number of rows as an argument.


Example:

```bash

python3 0-main.py 5

Output:


csharp
